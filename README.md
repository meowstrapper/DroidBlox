----

DroidBlox is a bootstrapper for Roblox's android client that gives you additional features.

It is a [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap) alternative to android except there are some features that are **not currently possible** in the android version. 

# DO NOT TRY TO DOWNLOAD AND USE THE APK BUILDS IN THE ACTION TABS, THIS APP ISN'T STILL RELEASED AND IS UNFINISHED

## THIS APP REQUIRES ROOT!!
Wait for me to release a version that doesn't require root. Right now the technique used for non-root configuration (by using clone apps) is patched.

# When will it release?
Anytime soon, maybe if I dont procasinate about making it.

# WARNING!
It's unsure if you will get banned on Roblox for using this, if you have been banned, join [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/zFspvBwH92) and send the ban screenshot there.

The discord rich presence feature uses the Discord gateway connection. **Use it at your own risk.**

# Features
- **Integrations**
    - Launch other intents while launching Roblox (coming soon)
- **Activity Tracking**
    - Notifies you about your current server's location
    - Be able to set your RPC about your playing status (with [BloxstrapRPC](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Integrating-Bloxstrap-functionality-into-your-game) supported) 
    - Choose if you want others to join you by looking at your RPC
    - Be able to rejoin the last game at the same server you joined
- **Fast Flags**
    - Be able to customize them with ease
    - Merge your current fast flags with other ones
    - Retain your fast flags after updating
    - NOTE! Due to [Roblox's new policy that limits some fast flags](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569), some might only work when you set them at the Fast Flags section.

# But where's texture configuration?
Roblox recently loaded their assets inside the APK and I cannot find a way to modify the assets **without configuring the APK** which was possible before.

# TODO List
- [ ] Figure out how to set assets
- [x] Make the UX Design with KivyMD
- [ ] Optimize things

# WHY IS IT PYTHON!1!! ITS SO SLOW YK???
I only know python, ehh.. Feel free to recreate my project in Kotlin, Java, or other languages with credits by linking this github repository at yours.

# NOTE
Will be refactored into kotlin soon :33

## Building & Testing
1. Depending on your OS, you will need **OpenJDK 17** with the environment variables properly set (e.g. JAVA_HOME) and **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**
2. Clone this repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/meowstrapper/DroidBlox
$ cd DroidBlox
```
3. Install pip requirements
```sh
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Build the APK (takes around >≈ 50 mins at the first build and >≈ 10 mins for next builds, depends on your hardware)
```sh
$ buildozer -v android debug # outputs apk to bin/dbtools-(VERSION)-(ARCH)-debug.apk
```
5. Install the APK
```sh
$ adb install bin/dbtools-(VERSION)-(ARCH)-debug.apk
```
6. Launch the APK and get the logcat output
```sh
$ adb logcat --pid $(adb shell pidof com.drake.dbtools)
