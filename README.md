----

DroidBlox is a bootstrapper for Roblox's android client that gives you additional features.

It is a [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap) alternative to android except there are some features that are **not currently possible** in the android version. 

# When will it release?
Anytime soon, maybe if I dont procasinate about making it.

# WARNING!
This application uses [SpaceCore](https://github.com/FSpaceCore/SpaceCore/) which is not open source.
It's also unsure if you will get banned on Roblox for using this.
I am not responsible if you got banned or your phone got a virus for using it ([make an issue](https://github.com/meowstrapper/DroidBlox/issues) if it ever happens) so **use it at your own risk!!**

# Features
- **Integrations**
    - Launch other intents while launching Roblox
- **Activity Tracking**
    - Notifies you about your current server's location
    - Be able to set your RPC about your playing status (with [BloxstrapRPC](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Integrating-Bloxstrap-functionality-into-your-game) supported) 
    - Choose if you want others to join you by looking at your RPC
    - Be able to rejoin the last game at the same server you joined
- **Fast Flags**
    - Be able to customize them with ease
    - Merge your current fast flags with other ones
    - Retain fast flags after updating

# But where's texture configuration?
Roblox recently loaded their assets inside the APK and I cannot find a way to modify the assets **without configuring the APK** which was possible before.

# TODO List
- [ ] Figure out how to set assets
- [ ] Make the UX Design with KivyMD
- [ ] Optimize things

# WHY IS IT PYTHON!1!! ITS SO SLOW YK???
I only know python, ehh.. Feel free to recreate my project in Kotlin, Java, or other languages with credits by linking this github repository at yours.
